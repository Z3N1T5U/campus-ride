## Features

- **User & Captain Authentication:** Role-based sign-up, login, JWT authentication, and secure access control for users and captains.
- **Real-Time Ride Tracking:** Using Socket.io to establish real-time connections for live ride updates, including ride status, captain location, and OTP-based ride start.
- **Dynamic Map Integration:** Leaflet is used for displaying and interacting with maps, showing routes, captain locations, and ride destinations in real-time.
- **Ride Lifecycle Management:** Full ride flow: Create ride → Calculate fare → Captain confirmation → OTP verification → Start/End ride.
- **Captain Vehicle Info & Availability:** Captains register with vehicle details and are shown in real-time to users when searching for nearby rides.
- **Distance & Time Calculation:** Uses mapping APIs to calculate estimated fare, distance, and time between two geolocations.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user, captain, and ride data.
- **Express.js:** Backend API built with RESTful structure and validation.
- **React.js:** Front-end UI with reusable components and real-time updates.
- **Node.js:** Server runtime to handle business logic and connections.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time communication between users and captains for ride updates.
- **Leaflet.js:** Interactive mapping to visualize pickups, drop-offs, and captain movements.
